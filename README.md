# Project Title
Tracking emotional wellbeing using emotional analysis on social media

#Problem Statement/Opportunity
The proliferations of internet and communication technologies, especially the online social networks have rejuvenated how people interact and communicate with each other electronically. The applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and alike not only host the written and multimedia contents but also offer their users to express their feelings, emotions and sentiments about a topic, subject or an issue online. In order to provide such insight, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques could potentially offer some unique features that can assist in examining the unique patterns hidden in online communication and process them to reveal the mental state (such as ‘happiness’, ‘sadness’, ‘anger’, ‘anxiety’, depression) among social networks’ users. Moreover, there is growing body of literature addressing the role of social networks on the structure of social relationships such as breakup relationship, mental illness (‘depression’, ‘anxiety’, ‘bipolar’ etc.), smoking and drinking relapse, sexual harassment and for suicide ideation.

# Project Description
The core idea of my project is to analyze social network data for user’s feelings and sentiments to investigate their moods and attitudes when they are communicating via these online tools. Social networks have been developed as a great point for its users to communicate with their interested friends and share their opinions, photos, and videos reflecting their moods, feelings and sentiments. This creates an opportunity to analyze social network data for user’s feelings and sentiments to investigate their moods and attitudes when they are communicating via these online tools. Instead of sifting through each Facebook comment or Tweet, and labelling them as positive or negative, one can harness the power of sentiment analysis to automatically sort social media data. One can also connect sentiment analysis tools to your customer support software, allowing you to listen to the voice of the customer in real time, prioritize negative comments and, in doing so, improve brand reputation and prevent customer churn. With sentiment analysis tools, one will be able to quantify all unstructured data and use data visualization tools to transform text data into valuable customer insights: reveal trends and patterns over time, easily spot customer pain points, and make data-based decisions that will improve brand reputation and drive your business forward.
